# AES Encryption with Fixed Round Key

This project implements the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** algorithm with a fixed round key (`FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) for key expansion. The implementation includes:
- AES encryption and decryption.
- Key expansion using a fixed round key.
- Core AES operations: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.
- Analysis of quantization error and Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR).

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the AES encryption and decryption process using a fixed round key (`FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) for key expansion. The implementation includes:
- **Key Expansion**: Fixed round key is used for generating round keys.
- **Encryption**: Core AES operations are applied to encrypt the input data.
- **Decryption**: Reverse operations are applied to decrypt the encrypted data.

## Implementation Details

### Key Expansion
- A fixed round key (`FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) is used for key expansion.
- The Rijndael key expansion algorithm generates round keys for 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key lengths.

### Core AES Operations
1. **SubBytes**: Non-linear substitution using the AES S-box.
2. **ShiftRows**: Cyclic shifting of rows in the state matrix.
3. **MixColumns**: Linear transformation of columns in the state matrix.
4. **AddRoundKey**: XOR operation with the round key.

### Encryption and Decryption
- The input data is encrypted using the AES algorithm.
- The encrypted data is decrypted using the reverse AES operations.

## Key Features
- **Fixed Round Key**: Uses `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` for key expansion.

## Results
The project produces the following outputs:
1. **Encrypted Data**: Output of the AES encryption process.
2. **Decrypted Data**: Output of the AES decryption process.
